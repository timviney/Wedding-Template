# Tailwind CSS
# Usually, you commit the source CSS file, but not the compiled output.
# If your setup auto-generates a temporary file or a final compressed file
# *outside* of the main build folder (which is already ignored), add it here.
# (E.g., if a file named 'main.css' is generated in the root.)
# Generally, this is handled by the build/dist rules above.
# If you see an uncommitted generated CSS file, add its path.
